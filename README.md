# Graph-Based Fraud Detection on the Ethereum Blockchain

This repository contains the implementation of the method described in our paper:
**"Fraud Identification Method in Blockchain Network using Machine Learning and Graph"**

---

## 🚀 Overview

We extract suspicious patterns from Ethereum transaction data after visualizing the Transaction Graph, construct a labeled transaction graph, and use features like PageRank, and centrality measures in ML pipelines to detect fraudulent wallets.

## 📁 Directory Structure

- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks shows each step of the pipeline.
- `src/` — Python modules for graph construction, feature engineering, and model training.
- `figures/` — Key visualizations like heatmaps and fraud cycle graphs.

## 📚 Dataset

We use the open-source dataset from Zheng et al. (2020):
